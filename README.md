Hi everyone! My name is Mase. Im a 22 year old guy from the states, working and in school. I found out about Ponytown from a former friend in the agere community, ( completely sfw! if you have any questions about it you can ask me :) )and ever since then ive loved coming up with my own designs and hanging out! Im a bit awkward at first, but i try to be the first to initiate. Im looking for some friends to add on discord and chat with, so please dont be afraid to talk to me!
